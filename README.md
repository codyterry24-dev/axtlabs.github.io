## 🌟 Overview

AXT Labs is a next-generation research and engineering studio turning Nobel-aligned physics into production-grade AI systems. We build physics-anchored computing infrastructure for high-stakes domains: finance, cybersecurity, biotech, and digital twins.

Our core engine, **ZT-Core**, treats complex systems as energy landscapes with machine-checkable invariants—delivering validation at <1ms latency with 0% invariant violations.

## 💡 Mission Statement & Value Proposition

**Mission:** To transform Nobel-aligned physics into a production substrate for AI systems in risk, cybersecurity, biotech, and digital twins.

**Value Proposition:** We architect a new computational paradigm where physics and invariants are first-class citizens. Same hardware, different ceiling.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **0% Invariant Violations** vs 12% for LLM+GPU baselines
- **100% Feasible Solutions** vs 88% baseline
- **<1ms Validation Latency** at <5% CPU overhead
- **1.000 Memory Correlation** for perfect validation

## 🏛️ Two Entities, One Mission

### AMEL Foundation
The humanitarian arm focused on applying advanced computation to public-good problems in health, energy, education, and governance.

### AXT Labs
The for-profit studio that operationalizes research into deployable platforms, SDKs, and enterprise solutions. A share of AXT Labs' upside flows back into AMEL to fund open science and humanitarian deployments.

## ⚡ Core Products

### ZT-Core Risk Engine
Physics-anchored optimization and validation for portfolios, infrastructure configs, and digital twins. Encodes domain rules as machine-checkable invariants.

### BIOxPOD & FORCE Protocol
Deterministic RNA 3D folding and treatment design with full mathematical transparency. Built for labs and regulators that can't accept black-box heuristics.

### AXT-APEX & Digital Twins
Predator-logic cybersecurity, zero-trust proofs, and Aperion-grade digital twins for energy, industrial systems, and grid operations.
